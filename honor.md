I was trained as a computer scientist, but my
[research group](/collaborators/) has diverse interests 
in natural language processing, and we work on many problems in 
this area, from theoretical to empirical. We tend to focus on basic 
curiosity-driven research in areas that aren't yet well understood, in 
order to improve the foundations of the field. We view NLP as an
interdisciplinary field, and to do interdisciplinary research, you need a 
discipline. So I look for collaborators from mathematics, machine learning,
computer science, and linguistics. I don't expect you to be an expert in 
all of these fields---few people are---but I do expect you to learn 
something about all of them from a diverse of group of collaborators.
