  I am a undergraduate research student(_Junior now_) in the Artificial Intelligence 
Institute in the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/) at 
the [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/). I am advised by [Siliang Tang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/siliang) in ZJUAI/[DCD](http://www.dcd.zju.edu.cn/). 

  My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Applied Machine 
Learning. I am broadly interested in connecting natural language with real 
world scenarios, and using them to guide natural language understanding.

Before confirming my research interest in the field of natural language processing, 
I went to [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/cn/index.html) and [a startup company](https://www.eigentech.ai/en/) for internships in software development. 
When working in these companies that have given me a lot of experience, I happened to be 
involved in the group meeting of the Natural Language Processing Algorithm Group 
and this also opened the door of interests in this field. At the beginning of my 
junior year, I joined the school's natural language research group to accumulate 
basic knowledge about NLP and learn the solutions using the machine learning methods. 
I also slowly confirm NLP to be the research field I am willing to fight for.
