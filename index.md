I am a undergraduate research student in the Artificial Intelligence Institute 
in the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/) at the 
[Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/). I am advised by [Siliang Tang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/siliang) in ZJUAI/[DCD](http://www.dcd.zju.edu.cn/). 

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Applied Machine 
Learning. I am broadly interested in connecting natural language with real 
world scenarios, and using them to guide natural language understanding.
