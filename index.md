  I am a undergraduate research student(_Junior now_) in the Artificial Intelligence 
Institute in the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/) at 
[Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/). I am advised by Professor [Siliang Tang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/siliang) in ZJUAI/[DCD](http://www.dcd.zju.edu.cn/). 

  My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Applied Machine 
Learning. I am so interested in _Natural Language Understand_ and my dream of research 
is to build computers that can intelligently process, understand, and generate human 
language material. So I hope that the general area of my research is robust but 
linguistically sophisticated natural language understanding, and opportunities to use it in real-world domains. And my current topics include _Universal Dependency Parsing_ 
and _QA in Context_.

  Before confirming my research interest in the field of natural language processing, 
I went to [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/cn/index.html) and [a startup company](https://www.eigentech.ai/en/) for internships in software development. 
When working in these companies that have given me lots of experience, I happened to be 
involved in the group meeting of the Natural Language Processing Algorithm Group 
and this also opened my door of interests in this field. At the beginning of my 
junior year, I joined the school's natural language research group and began to 
accumulate basic knowledge about NLP and learn the solutions using the machine learning methods. 
And I also slowly confirm NLP to be the research field I am willing to fight for.
