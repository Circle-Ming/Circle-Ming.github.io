Hi! I am now a second-year PhD student in [SUTD](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/), advised 
by Professor [Soh De Wen](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/soh-de-wen). Before 
joined SUTD, I received my bachelor degree (with honors) from [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), where I am advised by Professor [Siliang Tang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/siliang) in ZJUAI/[DCD](http://www.dcd.zju.edu.cn/). 

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Applied Machine Learning.
I am so interested in **Natural Language Understand** and my dream of research is to 
build computers that can intelligently process, understand, and generate human language
material. So I hope that the general area of my research is robust but linguistically 
sophisticated natural language understanding, and opportunities to use it in real-world
domains. And my current topics include **Structure Prediction** and **Latent-structures guided NLP**.

Before confirming my research interest in the field of natural language processing, 
I went to [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/cn/index.html) and [a startup company](https://www.eigentech.ai/en/) for internships in software development and natural language processing algorithm engineering. Now I will also join Alibaba DAMO Academy as a NLP Research Intern.
